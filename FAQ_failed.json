If multiple orders are placed, the user needs to right-click on the order in the Open Positions or Pending Orders tab first. The answer also mentions the hotkey combination (Ctrl + F5) to partially close an order. The support representative should ensure that the user understands the difference between closing a whole order and partially closing an order.",

With Forex Tester you simulate trading in the past. Your charts will move just like they do in the live market, but the data will be coming from history and not from the live market. So you will get almost the same experience as you would get by trading live let's say in 2001 or 2021.\n\nBacktesting in Forex Tester has many advantages in comparison with testing your strategies on demo accounts because in Forex Tester you can:\n\n- Test any time period from history\n- Pause testing and continue later\n- Correct mistakes in manual testing (e.g. go back in time and cancel or restore a closed trade)\n- Control the testing speed\n- Test different (sets of) strategies in the same time period.\n- Test middle-term and long-term strategies much faster. With a demo account, it will take you forever to test your strategy because you will have to wait for the price to change. With Forex Tester you can speed up time and get the results much faster.\n- With Forex Tester you can test your strategy on different markers (different seasons, crises, news announcements, etc..). If you test your strategy only on a demo account, then there is a HUGE risk, that your results will be valid for one state of the market but completely invalid for other states of the market. So we strongly recommend testing your strategies on different parts of history (different states of the market).\n\nBy the way, wanna get more accurate backtesting results? Or do you crave to use high-quality historical data? You deserve all these must-have options, without which simulated trading takeoff is impossible.\n\nIf you are afraid that such \u201cluxuries\u201d are at a sky-high price, don\u2019t worry, scaredy-cat. The cost of the data service depends on the subscription period and type.\n\nChoose the best one according to your needs and preferences.
